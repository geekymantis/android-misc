###android simple apps

This repo includes some apps for android I started developing after following Adam Porter's course ([check it here](http://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1) [or here](https://github.com/aporter/coursera-android)).
Feel free to get some inspiration to start developing applications with Android :-)

All projects are made with [android studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html).
